# workflow-CWSA

This directory contains the main code of the following paper:

Liwen Yang, Yuanqing Xia, Yuanqing Xia, Xiaopu Zhang, Lingjuan Ye, and Yufeng Zhan, "Classification-Based Diverse Workflows Scheduling in Clouds," IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering, accepted, 2022, https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2022.3217666.

The directory "DAGclassificationWithTT-test" is the classification network.

The directory "generatedWorkflows" contains the used workflows.

The directory "workflowSchedulingAndLabel" labels each workflow to form data for the training classification network and implements workflow scheduling, which is redeveloped based on the framework of the following paper

Q. Wu, F. Ishikawa, Q. Zhu, Y. Xia, and J. Wen, "Deadline-constrained cost optimization approaches for workflow scheduling in clouds," IEEE Trans. Parallel Distrib. Syst., vol. 28, no. 12, pp. 3401â€“3412, Dec. 2017.
